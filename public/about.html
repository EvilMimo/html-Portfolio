<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Starting from a young age I had always wanted to become a plastic surgeon. As I grew older and 
  I began to develop a deep interest and appreciation for computers as a whole. It all started with My IBUYPOWER computer.
  This computer was essentially ancient compared to technology at the time and this had caused me to not only become frustrated with how slow it was
  but also begin to look into ways to upgrade it and keep the performance at it's best. I had surfed through all forums and every website you could find
  in order to begin to udnerstand how to work with computers. This is essentially what had led me to gain interest in the software itself. Now here we are today, completing my first ever projects and a portfolio to keep them all together.
